# LG Thinq CSharp API

Working on connecting to LG Thinq devices using LG Thinq servers through C#.
Allow easy control of devices and getting their status. Inspired by https://github.com/sampsyo/wideq

I only own Washing Machine and I will add commentary to methods.
There is example included.

I use IE Browser for login so no information other than token is passed into application.

I will appriciate any help.
